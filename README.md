# Welcome to the Railtrack Sense project!
This project aims to use IoT inertial sensing to monitor the quality of railway lines, enabling easy and automated detection of localised anomalies.

This project was started as a university project (DE4 Sensing and IoT, Dyson School of Design engineering, Imperial College London, 2025).
